SummVD's GitHub page

To run the experiments like in the paper we have built a user-friendly script :

Step 1 : Download via the google drive the datasets, word embedding and parameters : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QjobC4w9G7nd2eva5sURUQ5Ys3s93gan?usp=sharing
Keep the same file structure, which means that you have to put every file/folder like in the google drive in a folder called SummVD.

Step 2 : Download the github SummVD.py file, and put it to the root of the SummVD folder.

Step 3 : You need to have the packages from the requirements.txt with at least the same version on the most important packages which are : gensim==3.8.3 / scipy==1.6.3 / rouge-score==0.0.4 / sklearn == 0.17.2

Step 4 : You can now run the experiments as follow :
"python SummVD.py --dataset_name "dataset_name" --size_output 0 "
With dataset_name one of the following : "duc", "reddit", "cnn", "reddit_tifu", "MN" (for Multi-News), "pubmed", "xsum"
