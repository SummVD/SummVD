# SummVD's GitHub page

**This code runs with Python 3.8**

## To run the experiments like in the paper we have built a user-friendly script :

1. Download via the google drive the datasets, word embedding and parameters : [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QjobC4w9G7nd2eva5sURUQ5Ys3s93gan?usp=sharing)  
**You need to keep the same file structure**, which means that you have to put every file/folder like in the google drive in a folder called SummVD.

2. Download the github SummVD.py file, and put it to the **root of the SummVD folder**.

3. You need to have the packages from the requirements.txt with at least the same version on the most important packages which are : **gensim==3.8.3 / scipy==1.6.3 / rouge-score==0.0.4 / sklearn==0.17.2 / nltk==3.5 / numpy==1.19.2**

4. You can now run the experiments from the root of your SummVD folder as follow :  
```
python SummVD.py --dataset_name "dataset_name" --size_output 300  
```
**With dataset_name one of the following :** "duc", "reddit", "cnn", "reddit_tifu", "MN" (for Multi-News), "pubmed", "xsum". (size_output 0 means that we test the full length dataset. To run n examples, simply put n instead).

**Step 5** : As you will see, the output summaries are written in the output folder like : "dataset_name.txt". From here you can run our Rouge scorer by using : 
```
python SummVD.py --dataset_name "dataset_name" --scoring True
```
Note : You can also score your own summaries by replacing "dataset_name" by the name of your .txt file in the "output" folder.





## Experimental functions :

To run the full length dataset, for size_output put the value 0, a custom value will take the n first documents and abstracts of the dataset.

If you want to try a custom dataset, you will have to call it : dataset_name + "_documents.pkl" and the gold : dataset_name + "_gold.pkl". You will then be able to run it with :  
```
--dataset_name "dataset_name" --nb_sentences n --heuristic_rate xxx  
```
heuristic_rate (optionnal) means xxx * len(documents) to automaticaly choose the parameters. By default it is set to 0.004. Arrange yourself to have at least 15 or more examples in order to get the best results.  
The .pkl data has to work with :  
```
documents = pickle.load(open(dataset_name + "_documents.pkl", "rb"))
gold = pickle.load(open(dataset_name + "_gold.pkl", "rb"))
```

If you want to try a custom word embedding, it has to be in .pkl format. it has to work as follow : wordembedding["word"] => vector.  
In that case, simply add :  
```
--word_embedding_path "./Word Embedding Model/my_word_embedding.pkl"
```

If you only want to use our Rouge scoring you will have to use : python SummVD.py --dataset_name "dataset_name" --scoring True  
With the dataset added as dataset_name + "_documents.pkl" and the gold : dataset_name + "_gold.pkl" in Datasets folder.  
Your summaries will have to be in output folder as "dataset_name.txt"

We present here the method associated with the output made of the same number of sentences announced in the paper.  
Better results can be achieved with different number of sentences, refered as "n". 
    
     
      
      
## TextRank computation time against SummVD on very long text :    
After seing the results shown in the paper, one can wonder how does our method compare to TextRank on very long documents.
We implement this comparaison by concatenating X number of documents from any dataset, and running both methods on this newly created very long document.
You can run the experiment for each dataset using the following : 

```
python SummVD.py --dataset_name "dataset_name" --size_output 200 --longDocument "summvd"
```
Note that --longDocument "summvd" runs the experiment for summvd, then you can lauch it for TextRank using : 
```
--longDocument "textrank"
```
We obtained the following times using CNN and the concatenation of 200/500/1000/10000 documents (note that the results may vary depending on your system): 

| Number of documents concatenated (CNN) | TextRank | SummVD | 
|---|---|---| 
| 200 | 44s | 45s | 
| 500 | 301s | 132s |  
| 1000 | 1219s | 284s | 
| 10000 | +20h | 4731s |
